xdg-desktop-portal-phosh (0.44~dev) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: Use canonical portal name.
    While pmp is our symbol prefix for the C side the portal is the "Phosh"
    portal so name it accordingly.
  * packaging: Conflict with older phosh.
    This ensures we don't have a file conflict
  * treewide: Bump versions.
    This allows packaging relations to work

xdg-desktop-portal-phosh (0.42.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: Use canonical name.
  * build: Drop post install hooks.
    We don't install schemas or icons and otherwise fail on empty /usr/local.
  * build: Unset structured logging.  Needed to make --verbose work
  * settings: Fix memory leak
  * settings: Don't notify icon-theme on theme changes.
  * settings: Add support for contrast value.

  [ fossdd ]
  * data: Add option for systemd_user_unit_dir.
    So that systems without systemd-dev can still build the portal.

  [ Eugenio Paolantonio (g7) ]
  * settings: Add accent colour support.
    Heavily based on the corresponding commit from xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    (d431d434726440be96f20d2a43efcc135d4d1cb6) by Jamie Murphy.
  * build: Bump dependencies for accent colour support
    gsettings-desktop-schemas >= 47, and libadwaita >= 1.6
