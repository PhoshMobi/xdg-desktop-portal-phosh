xdg-desktop-portal-phosh (0.44.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * pfs: Switch to 0.0.1 release.
    A bit easier to follow than a commit hash
  * file-chooser: Handle read only flag.
    We add it to the choices and filter it out when getting the result.
    While at that wrap passed in choices lists in a variant as that is
    what pfs currently expects.
    To test: gnome-text-editor sets a choices menu

  * gitignore: Drop unused files and patterns. Users should gitignore their
    editor files
  * ci: Install git for subproject downloads
  * filechooser: New portal.
    The overall structure is based on the GTK file chooser portal. We use
    pfs as a git submodule for the actual dialog.
  * tools: Drop check-po.
    We use our shared checks since some time
    Fixes 44f3faa ("ci: Update CI with our common checks")
  * subprojects: Forward pfs project.
    Forward up to
      3fcb219 ("file-selector: Remember sort mode")
    so have persistent sort mode
  * packaging: Install schemas.
    We ship them from here as the portal is the primary pfs user
    atm.
  * build: Use canonical portal name. While pmp is our symbol prefix for
    the C side the portal is the "Phosh" portal so name it accordingly.
  * packaging: Conflict with older phosh. This ensures we don't have a
    file conflict

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: Use canonical name.
  * build: Drop post install hooks.
    We don't install schemas or icons and otherwise fail on empty /usr/local.
  * build: Unset structured logging.  Needed to make --verbose work
  * settings: Fix memory leak
  * settings: Don't notify icon-theme on theme changes.
  * settings: Add support for contrast value.

  [ fossdd ]
  * data: Add option for systemd_user_unit_dir.
    So that systems without systemd-dev can still build the portal.

  [ Eugenio Paolantonio (g7) ]
  * settings: Add accent colour support.
    Heavily based on the corresponding commit from xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
    (d431d434726440be96f20d2a43efcc135d4d1cb6) by Jamie Murphy.
  * build: Bump dependencies for accent colour support
    gsettings-desktop-schemas >= 47, and libadwaita >= 1.6
